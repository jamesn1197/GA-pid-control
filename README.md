# GA-pid-control
This is an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) used to tune a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The GA is parallelized using MPI for cloud computing. The PID controller operates on a 2 state, Linear, Discrete-time model. The populations are managed using SQLite.
A report on my contribution to this is included, along with a general overview of the contributions of @pyrosnowman24 and @dvd9604, who can be found here:
